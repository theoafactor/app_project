Once code is pushed: 

A. 
1. SSH into the Instance
2. Install Docker in the EC2 instance <-- Check if Docker is installed (Install if not installed already)


B.
1. Build a docker image
2. Push the Docker image to Docker Hub
3. Pull the Docker image into our EC2 instance(VIrtual machine) <--- Log into the instance (SSH)
    -> THis means the EC2 instance should have dOCKER installed
4. Run the Docker image as a container
-----
5. Configure Domain name for our deployment 


--- SSH into EC2 instance ---
1. Private key 
2. username 
3. ip address or DNS 

> ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i xxxxxx ubuntu@123.40.34.55




Future
1. Push to dev branch
2. Test the code in the dev branch
3. If the test passed, it will nerge with master branch ...
4. ON MERGE: Run the rest of the steps in the CICD
